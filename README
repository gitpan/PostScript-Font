This package contains a couple of modules to get information for and
from PostScript fonts and associated metrics files. Also included is a
module to facilitate basic typesetting, a program to make font
samples, and programs to handle the conversion of font data to
PostScript binary (.pfb) and ASCII (.pfa) formats. Example program
shows how basic typesetting can be obtained.

Modules:

   PostScript::Resources - fetch info from Unix PostScript Resource files

			Unix PostScript Resource (.upr) files are the
			Adobe specified way of defining PostScript
			resources on Unix systems. Using .upr files,
			font names and families are associated with
			their metrics and outline data.

   PostScript::Font   - get information from a PostScript font file

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name, but also encoding vector and list
			of glyphs.
			Font types 1 and 42 are supported; types 2, 3
			and 5 are usually handled as well.
			TrueType fonts are internally converted to
			Type42 fonts, using an external conversion
			tool (not included).

   PostScript::FontMetrics - get information from Adobe Font Metrics file

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name, encoding vector, width and
			kerning tables.

			A example program is provided that shows how
			to use the metrics for basic typesetting of
			PostScript texts.

   PostScript::PrinterFontMetrics - get information from Printer Font Metrics file

			Like PostScript::FontMetrics, but gets the
			information from a .PFM file instead.

   PostScript::FontInfo - get information from Windows .INF files

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name and PC filename prefix.

   PostScript::BasicTypesetter
   PostScript::PseudoISO - tools for basic typesetting

			These modules contains functions to do basic
			typesetting, like setting paragraphs of text
			using different fonts, colors, styles, and
			alignments (left, right, center and
			justified). All with kerning applied.
			Note that these modules are currently
			experimental.

Programs:

   fontsampler        - makes detailed or concise sample pages of fonts

			In detailed mode, one or more pages are
			produced to show all the glyphs of the font.
			Otherwise, just a sample of the font is
			printed, allowing for 40 or more font samples
			per page.
			The output is compliant with Adobe's Document
			Structuring Conventions version 3.0.

   font2pfa	      - decodes a font file to ASCII (.pfa) format

			The input format may be any type that
			PostScript::Font can deal with.

   font2pfb	      - encodes a font file to binary (.pfb) format

			The input format may be any type that
			PostScript::Font can deal with.

To install, unpack the archive, change to the unpacked directory, and
type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make all test
    make install
