This package contains a couple of modules to get information from
PostScript fonts and associated metrics files. Also included is a
program to make font samples, and programs to handle the conversion of
PostScript fonts from binary (.pfb) format to ASCII (.pfa) format, and
vice versa.

Modules:

   PostScript::Font   - get information from a PostScript font file

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name, but also encoding vector and list
			of glyphs.
			Font types 1 and 42 are supported; types 2, 3
			and 5 are usually handled as well.

   PostScript::FontMetrics - get information from Adobe Font Metrics file

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name, encoding vector, width and
			kerning tables.

   PostScript::FontInfo - get information from Windows .INF files

			Information includes the font name, font
			family name and PC filename prefix.

Programs:

   fontsampler        - makes detailed or concise sample pages of fonts

			In detailed mode, one or more pages are
			produced to show all the glyphs of the font.
			Otherwise, just a sample of the font is
			printed, allowing for 40 or more font samples
			per page.
			The output is compliant with Adobe's Document
			Structuring Conventions version 3.0.

   font2pfa	      - decodes a font file to ASCII (.pfa) format

   font2pfb	      - encodes a font file to binary (.pfb) format

To install, unpack the archive, change to the unpacked directory, and
